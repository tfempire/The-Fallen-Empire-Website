Fallen Website
============
**Be aware that this project is still a work in progress and may not work properly yet!**

This is the website for The Fallen Empire. It is an application/extension/plugin for the [Woltlab Community Framework 2.1 (WCF 2.1)]. This code is not a proper implementation since there seems to be no full documentation of the WCF and we are way to lazy to examine every single class by ourself.

The Fallen Website uses the The Fallen Empire Web API and contains some modifications which have been done by us to the WCF an the [WBB (Woltlab Burning Board)] (not available anymore, is now part of the Woltab Suite).

We're hoping to replace the WCF (and the WBB) with our own framework ([Simple Framework]) once it is in a useable state.
