Fallen Website
============
**Be aware that this project is still a work in progress and may not work properly yet!**

This is the website for The Fallen Empire. It is an application/extension/plugin for the [Woltlab Community Framework 2.1 (WCF 2.1)]. This code does not represent the way Woltlab has intended the WCF to be used. But we don't care since there is no proper/full documentation of it (and we are waaaaay to lazy to examine every single class by ourself).

The Fallen Website interacts with the The Fallen Empire Web API and contains some modifications which have been done by us to the WCF an the [WBB (Woltlab Burning Board)].

We're hoping to replace the WCF (and the WBB) with our own framework ([Simple Framework]) once it is in a useable state.
