The Fallen Empire Website
=
**Be aware that this project is still a work in progress and may not work properly yet!**

This is the website for The Fallen Empire. It is an application/extension/plugin for the [Woltlab Community Framework 2.1 (WCF 2.1)]. This code does not represent the way Woltlab has intended the WCF to be used. But we don't care since there is no proper/full documentation of it (and we are waaaaay to lazy to examine every single class by ourself).

The 'The Fallen Empire Website' interacts with the '[The Fallen Empire Web API]' and contains some modifications which have been done by us to the WCF an the [WBB (Woltlab Burning Board)].

We're hoping to replace the WCF (and the WBB) with our own framework ([Simple Framework]) once it is in a useable state.
